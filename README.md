# HW4 — EX04: Graph-Based Reverse Engineering with AI Agents

> Reverse-engineer an **unfamiliar** Python repository the way a senior engineer would if they had a knowledge graph and a disciplined agent crew: build a dependency graph, navigate it as an Obsidian vault + LLM wiki, detect **architectural** defects with evidence-chained findings, attempt a **test-guarded** fix, and **prove** that graph-guided retrieval is cheaper than naive context-stuffing in a frozen A/B experiment.

**Target analysed:** [`pallets/werkzeug`](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug) @ `1b00618e` — the WSGI toolkit under Flask (138 `.py` files / 27,498 LOC).

> Course: **Lecture 07 — Reverse Engineering of Graph Knowledge Systems** (Dr. Yoram Segal, June 2026).
> Governing docs: [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md), [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md), [`docs/TODO.md`](docs/TODO.md) (539 tasks), and **7 dedicated mechanism PRDs**.

## TL;DR — headline results

| KPI (PRD §3.2) | Target | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Token savings + quality** (rubric KPI) | savings, with B correctness & citation ≥ A | ✅ **58.7%** savings with blind quality B≥A (correctness 1.20≥1.15, citation 0.70≥0.65) | [`results/experiment/SCORING.md`](results/experiment/SCORING.md) |
| **Validated architectural defects** | ≥ 2 | ✅ **2** — `http` god-node (F-005), `datastructures` god-node (F-001) | [`results/FINDINGS.md`](results/FINDINGS.md) §3 |
| **Automated fix** (tests green + graph improves) | ≥ 1 or honest analysis | ✅ **honest NO_SAFE_ACTION** (green but no structural gain → reverted) | [`results/loop_log.json`](results/loop_log.json), `results/dashboard.md` |
| **Concrete bug fixed** (graph-guided debug, §5.3–5.4) | find → root-cause → verified fix | ✅ **real** bugs in `andela/buggy-python` — their own harness now prints *All test passed* (+ a gate-verified planted demo) | [`BUG_ANALYSIS_buggy_python.md`](results/BUG_ANALYSIS_buggy_python.md) |
| **Coverage** | ≥ 85% | ✅ **≈96%** | `scripts/check_gates.py` |
| **Quality gates** | ruff 0 · ≤150 code-lines/file · no hardcodes/secrets | ✅ **GREEN** | `scripts/check_gates.py` |
| **Cost discipline** | under $10 firewall, every call ledgered | ✅ **$0.088** / 109 calls | [`results/ledger.jsonl`](results/ledger.jsonl) |

*The validated result is **58.7% savings with answer quality ≥ naive** (blind LLM-as-judge scoring, `results/experiment/SCORING.md`). Pushing to 89.8% savings (run-2) broke quality — reported honestly as the savings/quality cliff, not the headline.*

## What this is & why a graph

Pasting whole files into a model to ask "how does this repo work?" burns the context window before insight arrives, and — per *Lost in the Middle* (Liu et al., 2024) — buries the relevant lines where attention is weakest. This project replaces file-stuffing with a **knowledge graph** of the codebase and retrieves only the **ego-subgraph + distilled wiki pages** a question actually needs.

The deliverable answers three task tiers over any repo:

- **locate** — "where is X implemented?"
- **trace-path** — "how does a request become a response?"
- **impact** — "what breaks if I change Y?"

…and goes further: it **detects** architectural smells (god modules, single points of failure, isolation, doc↔code traceability gaps), **attempts to fix** them under a test-and-graph-diff guard, and **measures** the token economics of the whole approach.

A guiding rule throughout: **deterministic spine, LLM at the edges.** Graph extraction, metrics, community detection, diffs, detectors, and loop control are plain, testable Python. The LLM only writes narratives, plans, and edits — and never without passing through the gate.

## Documentation

This project was written **docs-before-code** (guidelines §1.4): the requirements, architecture, and task plan existed before the first line was implemented, and each non-trivial mechanism got its own PRD. The full set lives in [`docs/`](docs/):

- **Governing docs** — [`PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md) (problem, KPIs, functional/non-functional requirements, risks) · [`PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) (architecture, C4/UML, the ADRs) · [`TODO.md`](docs/TODO.md) (541-task plan tracked phase by phase).
- **Mechanism PRDs (7)** — one per subsystem: [`PRD_graph_pipeline.md`](docs/PRD_graph_pipeline.md) · [`PRD_defect_detection.md`](docs/PRD_defect_detection.md) · [`PRD_fix_loop.md`](docs/PRD_fix_loop.md) · [`PRD_gatekeeper.md`](docs/PRD_gatekeeper.md) · [`PRD_token_experiment.md`](docs/PRD_token_experiment.md) · [`PRD_agent_orchestration.md`](docs/PRD_agent_orchestration.md) · [`PRD_agent_evaluation.md`](docs/PRD_agent_evaluation.md).
- **Process & reference** — [`PROMPTS.md`](docs/PROMPTS.md) (the AI prompt log) · [`SCORING_RUBRIC.md`](docs/SCORING_RUBRIC.md) (blind experiment scoring) · [`SKILL.md`](docs/SKILL.md) + [`SKILL_token_experiment.md`](docs/SKILL_token_experiment.md) (SKILL protocols) · [`TARGET_REPO.md`](docs/TARGET_REPO.md) (target provenance + unfamiliarity attestation).

Key generated artifacts referenced throughout: [`results/FINDINGS.md`](results/FINDINGS.md), [`results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md`](results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md), [`results/CONFUSION_MATRIX.md`](results/CONFUSION_MATRIX.md), [`results/graphs/i00/GRAPH_REPORT.md`](results/graphs/i00/GRAPH_REPORT.md), and the Obsidian [`vault/`](vault/).

## Research questions (§4) — answered

The assignment's eight research questions, each answered with a link to the evidence:

1. **What is the real architecture, and what wasn't obvious at first glance?** werkzeug is a layered WSGI toolkit whose namespace backbone (`datastructures`, re-exporting ~10 container families) and a `sansio` core behind the `wrappers.request`/`.response` façades are *not* visible from the file tree — the graph surfaced them. → [Findings](#findings--7-god-nodes--1-traceability-gap-2-validated), [`results/FINDINGS.md`](results/FINDINGS.md).
2. **Which components/modules/classes/functions are most central?** Ranked by the bottleneck rubric: `werkzeug.datastructures` (fan-in 66), `werkzeug.http`, `wrappers.request/response`. → [`GRAPH_REPORT.md`](results/graphs/i00/GRAPH_REPORT.md), [`hot.md`](vault/20_Projects/werkzeug-analysis/hot.md).
3. **Where are the complexity hotspots / mixed responsibilities / God Nodes?** 7 god-node hypotheses, 2 validated (`http` bundles ≥6 header families; `datastructures` is a re-export backbone); healthy hubs *rejected* to avoid false positives. → [Findings](#findings--7-god-nodes--1-traceability-gap-2-validated).
4. **How do you extract block diagrams + OOP schema when docs are missing/partial?** From the graph's `implements`/`imports`/`calls` edges — rendered as mermaid block + class diagrams. → [Architecture](#architecture), [`results/FINDINGS.md`](results/FINDINGS.md) (classDiagram).
5. **How did you identify the bug, what was the root cause, what led you to it?** Failing spec → graph `tested_by` edge → `httprange.parser` → off-by-one (`end - start` vs `+ 1`, inclusive RFC 9110 range). → [Debugging case](#debugging-case--graph-guided-bug-fix), [`results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md`](results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md).
6. **Advantage of graph navigation (Obsidian) over linear file reading?** `index.md`/`hot.md` + the ego-subgraph put the *defining* module one hop from the question, instead of grepping ranked files; the experiment shows it also cites the right source more often. → [Token experiment](#token-experiment--587-savings-with-quality-preserved-the-honest-result).
7. **How does the AI agent save tokens / avoid unnecessary code reads via the graph?** It localizes on the graph first and requests **only** the implicated module — 273 vs 560 tok (debug case), and **58.7%** fewer input tokens at equal answer quality (Q&A experiment). → [Debugging case](#debugging-case--graph-guided-bug-fix), [Token experiment](#token-experiment--587-savings-with-quality-preserved-the-honest-result).
8. **Which extensions / agent mechanisms would you add later?** Already added: confusion-matrix evaluation, a real Graphify backend, threaded wiki generation, the Refactor Truth Dashboard. Next: dynamic `hot.md` from `git diff`, suspect ranking by proximity to failing tests, a multi-agent fix↔QA debate. → [Key design decisions](#key-design-decisions-adrs-in-docsplanmd-5).

## Installation

Prerequisites: `git` and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`). uv provisions the pinned Python automatically (developed on uv-managed CPython 3.12.13; `requires-python >=3.10`). **No pip, no manual venv — uv only.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yosefshanaa/HW4 && cd HW4
uv sync                                   # full environment from uv.lock
cp .env-example .env                       # then add a real key for the configured provider
                                           # (llm.provider in config/setup.json; currently OPENAI_API_KEY)
uv run pytest -q                           # ~350 tests, coverage gate 85%
uv run python scripts/check_gates.py       # all submission gates → GATES: GREEN
```

**Troubleshooting (issues we actually hit):**
- *`uv run` appears to hang for minutes* — on a Windows `/mnt/c` mount uv re-copies the venv (no hardlinks). Don't run two `uv run` concurrently; let one `UV_LINK_MODE=copy uv sync` finish.
- *`Failed to spawn: hw4` right after a fresh sync* — the console script wasn't flushed yet; re-run, or use `uv run --no-sync hw4 …`.
- *`.env` not picked up* — load it explicitly: `set -a && . ./.env && set +a`. Watch for editors saving `.env` as `.env.txt`.

## Usage tour

The CLI is a 1:1 thin shell over `Hw4Sdk`:

```bash
uv run hw4 graph workspace/target            # immutable graph iteration + metrics
uv run hw4 analyze                           # detectors → results/findings.json + FINDINGS.md
uv run hw4 analyze --agents                  # same findings + CrewAI careful-language narratives
uv run hw4 evaluate                          # confusion matrix vs mini_repo answer key (L07 §13.2)
uv run hw4 debug                             # graph-guided bug fix on buggy_case → results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md
uv run hw4 vault                             # Obsidian vault + LLM wiki pages
uv run hw4 ask "where is the routing Map implemented?"  # graph-guided, cited answer
uv run hw4 fix F-005                          # test-guarded fix loop on a validated finding
uv run hw4 experiment --condition both        # frozen A/B token experiment
uv run hw4 report --dashboard                 # REPORT.md + Refactor Truth Dashboard
```

Example — the deterministic-vs-agent equivalence (a graded claim): `analyze` and `analyze --agents` produce **byte-identical `findings.json`**; the crew only adds prose. *Determinism for the science, agents for the demonstration.*

### Graph backend — AST (default) or Graphify (ADR-4)

The course tool [Graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) ([graphify.net](https://graphify.net/)) is a real, obtainable Tree-sitter + NetworkX extractor that exports `graph.json` in **node-link format**. `hw4` ships a tested adapter that ingests that genuine output, so you can run either backend via `config/setup.json → graph.backend`:

```bash
# Default: the in-repo AST backend (deterministic, token-free, reproducible) —
# all committed findings/experiment artifacts are built with this.
uv run hw4 graph workspace/target

# Graphify backend: run Graphify yourself, then point hw4 at its graph.json.
npx graphify .                                          # produces ./graph.json (node-link)
HW4__graph__backend=graphify \
HW4__graph__graphify__graph_json=$PWD/graph.json \
  uv run hw4 graph workspace/target                     # adapter normalizes → our contract

# Or let hw4 invoke Graphify for you (cwd = repo) via a configured command:
#   "graph": { "backend": "graphify", "graphify": { "command": ["npx","graphify","."] } }
```

Either backend emits the Graphify-parity deliverables: `graph.json` plus a human-readable [`GRAPH_REPORT.md`](results/graphs/i00/GRAPH_REPORT.md) (node/edge/evidence breakdown, top bottlenecks, largest communities) written beside it on every `hw4 graph` build.

The adapter (`src/hw4/services/extractor/graphify.py`) only translates structure (`links`→edges, `source`/`target`→`src`/`dst`, Graphify's `confidence` evidence class → our `evidence` + `confidence_score`→confidence, `file_type`→node type) and validates at the single `Graph.from_dict` boundary. **We keep AST as the default on purpose:** the frozen experiment, findings, and content-hash determinism must reproduce without an external tool — Graphify is an honest drop-in, not a swap that would invalidate committed evidence (see ADR-4 in [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md)).

### Parallelism (guidelines §15)

Wiki generation is the genuine bottleneck: one **I/O-bound** LLM call per page (44 pages on werkzeug), each idle on the network. So it is parallelized with a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`config vault.wiki_workers`, default 4) — threads, not processes, because the work is I/O-bound, not CPU-bound (guidelines §15: CPU-bound→multiprocessing, I/O-bound→multithreading). Extraction/metrics stay single-threaded; they are CPU-bound and already cheap.

Concurrency is only safe because the two pieces of **shared mutable state are locked**:
- `ApiGatekeeper` reserves a rate slot under a `threading.Lock` *at admission* (before the call), so N threads can never collectively overshoot the rate window; the slow network call and its retries run **outside** the lock, so throttling never serializes real work.
- `Ledger` guards the JSONL append and read-back with a lock, so concurrent `record()` calls never lose a row or tear a line.

Rendering, file writes, and the vault log stay on the main thread, so the audit trail is the *only* contended resource — and it is locked. Proven by `tests/unit/test_concurrency.py`: 64 concurrent calls lose no ledger rows, produce no torn JSONL, and a saturated gatekeeper queues every call (never drops) under 8-way contention.

### Findings — 7 god-nodes + 1 traceability gap, 2 validated

| ID | Kind | Node | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F-005** | GOD_NODE | `werkzeug.http` | ✅ **validated** | 1,543 LOC bundling ≥6 header families (cookies, etags, dates, ranges, accept/cache-control/csp); fan-in **21** importers, no per-concern seam |
| **F-001** | GOD_NODE | `werkzeug.datastructures` | ✅ **validated** | rank-1 bottleneck; degree 76, fan-in 66, reaches 11 communities — a namespace backbone re-exporting ~10 container families |
| F-002 / F-003 | GOD_NODE | `wrappers.request` / `.response` | rejected | deliberate public façades over the `sansio` core |
| F-004 | GOD_NODE | `exceptions` | rejected | cross-cutting error layer; high fan-in is the protocol, one cohesive concern |
| F-006 / F-007 | GOD_NODE | `test.run_wsgi_app` / `utils` | rejected | test driver / low-cohesion utility grab-bag, not entangled cores |
| F-008 | TRACE_GAP | `wsgi.make_line_iter` | rejected | changelog records its **removal**; the symbol is correctly absent |

**No SPOF finding** — no node reaches `mandatory_path_ratio ≥ 0.3` (highest is `datastructures` at 0.106). werkzeug's hubs are reachable by multiple paths, unlike click's seam-less `echo`. Reported honestly rather than forced. Full 5-step inference per validated finding, plus the rejected-hypothesis analysis and block/class diagrams, in [`results/FINDINGS.md`](results/FINDINGS.md).

### Agent evaluation — confusion matrix on the planted fixture (L07 §13.2)

The detectors are a binary classifier, so they get a classifier's yardstick. `hw4 evaluate` runs the deterministic spine over [`tests/fixtures/mini_repo`](tests/fixtures/mini_repo) — a synthetic target whose README documents its planted defects *and* two false-positive guards — and scores findings against the machine-readable answer key. No LLM, no network; fully reproducible.

| | Actual defect | Actual clean | | Metric | Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pred defect** | TP = 3 | FP = 1 | | Precision | **0.75** |
| **Pred clean** | FN = 0 | TN = 2 | | Recall | **1.00** |

**Recall 1.00** — all three planted defects (god-node `app.engine`, orphan `orphan.legacy`, doc gap `app.plugins`) detected. The lone **FP** is the fixture's `conftest.py`: genuinely disconnected, so the isolation detector surfaces it for triage — reported as an honest precision cost, not hidden, in keeping with Part-C's "isolation is a finding, not a diagnosis." The healthy-hub guard (`app.utils`, high fan-in / one concern) stays unflagged — the two true negatives that keep precision from collapsing. We publish the real 0.75, not a hand-tuned 1.0. Full breakdown: [`results/CONFUSION_MATRIX.md`](results/CONFUSION_MATRIX.md), design in [`docs/PRD_agent_evaluation.md`](docs/PRD_agent_evaluation.md).

### Debugging case — graph-guided bug fix (§5.3–5.4)

Two debugging deliverables, because two different things are worth proving — and this repo carries **both** a large clean codebase (werkzeug, above) and a small buggy one.

**① Real discovered bug — [`andela/buggy-python`](https://github.com/andela/buggy-python)** (one of the EX04-suggested repos; the bugs were authored by *andela*, not by us). We graphified it ([`results/buggy_python/`](results/buggy_python/), 16 nodes / 18 edges), let the import graph localize the implicated `snippets` modules from the failing harness, and fixed **five real defects** — a mutable-default argument, a dict-vs-list loop, `!==` / `is "paid"` / `sun` / `length` / attribute-on-dict typos, and missing package exports. andela's **own** `main.py` harness now prints `All test passed successfully!! 😀`. Runs green at [`examples/buggy-python/`](examples/buggy-python/); full write-up in [`results/BUG_ANALYSIS_buggy_python.md`](results/BUG_ANALYSIS_buggy_python.md). *This is the genuine discovered fix — code neither of us wrote.*

The graph itself shows the fix: in the buggy state `io.py` has a syntax error (won't parse) and `__init__.py` is missing its exports, so graphify produces an **incomplete 10-node** graph; after the fix every module parses and every import resolves — a **whole 16-node** graph (+`io`'s four functions, +the resolved imports).

| Graphify — **before** the fix (buggy): `io.py` unparseable, exports missing | Graphify — **after** the fix: all modules parse, imports resolve |
|---|---|
| ![graphify of buggy-python before the fix — 10 nodes](assets/graphify_buggy_before.png) | ![graphify of buggy-python after the fix — 16 nodes](assets/graphify_buggy_after.png) |

**② Planted unit demonstration — [`tests/fixtures/buggy_case`](tests/fixtures/buggy_case).** A small, deterministic, **gate-verified** case so the workflow is covered by offline tests (no network). `uv run hw4 debug` reproduces → graph-localizes → verifies a red→green fix and writes [`results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md`](results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md):

- **Bug:** `httprange.parse_byte_range("bytes=0-499", 1000)` returns content-length **499**, but HTTP byte ranges are *inclusive* (RFC 9110 §14.1.2) → it must be **500**. A boundary bug that passes a casual read.
- **Root cause:** off-by-one — `length = end - start` instead of `end - start + 1`.
- **Graph-guided localization:** start from the failing test and follow the graph — `tests.test_range` →(`tested_by`)→ **`httprange.parser`**. The graph names the one file to open; no full-tree scan.
- **Fix (before→after):** `- end - start` → `+ end - start + 1`; the 4-case spec goes **red→green** (verified deterministically, no network).
- **Token comparison (§5.5, all four dimensions):** tokens **560→273** (51% fewer), files read **3→1**, research rounds (whole-package sweep → one graph localization + one read), and speed to root cause (scan all files → graph names the module). Full table in [`BUG_ANALYSIS.md`](results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md).
- **Agent (§5.3):** `uv run hw4 debug --agent` runs the CrewAI **analyst** on the spine — handed the symptom and **only** the graph-localized module's 273-token snippet (never the package), it writes the root-cause narrative to `results/agent_debug.md`, ledger-tagged `agent.analyst`. That snippet-on-demand reduction (graph first, one file second) *is* the efficiency mechanism. The fix is verified deterministically by the spec, not the LLM.
- **Knowledge-level before/after (§5.4):** the bug has its own Obsidian project [`vault/20_Projects/range-debug/`](vault/20_Projects/range-debug/) — a bug-focused `hot.md`, a `bug` page, and `knowledge-before-after.md` tabulating how understanding moved from "symptom only" to a graph-localized suspect with a pinned inclusive-range contract.

| Bug-focused `hot.md` — load this first (symptom → graph localization → suspect) | The `range-debug` vault project — the bug's pages in the tree |

### Fix loop (architectural) — an honest negative (T340)

The loop targeted the validated `http` god-node with the bounded GOD_NODE strategy (*extract the smallest cohesive group of private helpers into a sibling module, import them back, do not touch the public API*).

| Iteration | Target | Tests | Structure | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| i02 | F-005 `http` | **992/992 green** (behavior preserved) | bottleneck 0.106 → 0.106; isolated 1250 → 1253 | **regressed → REVERTED** |

**Stop reason: `NO_SAFE_ACTION`.** The extraction was behavior-preserving but didn't *improve* the structure (the god-node's fan-in of 21 external importers is unchanged by relocating private helpers), so the graph-diff guard reverted it. A green-but-non-improving refactor is **rejected, not faked** — the loop empirically restated finding F-005.

### Token experiment — 58.7% savings *with quality preserved* (the honest result)

10 questions (3 locate / 4 path / 3 impact), each spot-checked against source; 2 conditions × 2 repetitions; temperature 0; tokens taken **only** from provider API metadata via the ledger. Dataset sha256-sealed. Answer quality was scored **blind** by an LLM-as-judge (condition masked; sealed key opened only to tally) against the reference answers — full breakdown in [`results/experiment/SCORING.md`](results/experiment/SCORING.md).

| Run | Retrieval caps | Cond B tok/cell | Savings | Blind quality (B vs A) | Rubric KPI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Run 1** (validated) | radius 2 · 40 nodes · 3 seeds · 3 pages (default) | ~6.5k | **58.7%** | correctness **1.20 ≥ 1.15**, citation **0.70 ≥ 0.65** | ✅ **PASS** |
| Run 2 (over-tuned) | radius 1 · 20 nodes · 2 seeds · 2 pages | ~1.6k | 89.8% | correctness **0.50 ≪ 1.15**, citation 0.30 | ❌ FAIL |

**The validated result is Run 1: ~59% input-token savings (313,440 → 129,536) with answer quality *on par with, slightly above* naive context-stuffing** — the rubric KPI (B correctness *and* citation ≥ A) passes. Run 2 chased the ≥70% aspiration by tightening retrieval to ~1.6k tok/cell, but that **starved Condition B of context** → a wave of *"the material does not contain…"* non-answers, collapsing quality (KPI fail). Run 2 is archived (`*_run2.json`) and reported as the sensitivity study's **quality cliff**, not a result.

The honest finding: **for this target, ≥70% savings and preserved quality are in tension** — you get quality-preserving ~59% savings, or push toward ~90% and lose correctness. The safe operating point is the default caps (Run 1).

![per-question token savings (A vs B) and the 70% line](assets/experiment_savings.png)

> Methodology note: quality was scored by an **LLM-as-judge** (transparently labeled — *not* presented as human evaluation), a standard technique for an AI-orchestration course. The masked sheet + sealed key implement genuine blinding, and `results/experiment/scoring_worksheet.csv` supports an independent human re-score.

### The Obsidian vault

The graph becomes a navigable Obsidian vault under `vault/20_Projects/werkzeug-analysis/`: an **index-first** hub (the only default entry point), one LLM **wiki page per key entity** (5 hubs + 39 community pages), `raw/` provenance snapshots kept separate from distilled notes, and the SKILL protocol mirrored in-vault.

| Graph view — `index` at the centre, community clusters radiating out | `index.md` — the machine-owned navigation hub |
|---|---|
| ![Obsidian graph view of the werkzeug vault](assets/vault_graph.png) | ![index.md navigation hub](assets/vault_index.png) |
| **`werkzeug.datastructures` wiki — rank-1 god-node (F-001)** | **`werkzeug.wrappers` wiki — rank-5 dependency hub** |
| ![werkzeug.datastructures wiki page](assets/wiki_datastructures.png) | ![werkzeug.wrappers wiki page](assets/wiki_wrappers.png) |

Each wiki page carries an **evidence table** (EXTRACTED/INFERRED edges with their source files and confidence) plus open questions; the index ranks hubs by the graph's bottleneck metrics. A machine-owned **`hot.md`** focuses the critical area, and a second, smaller vault project — **`vault/20_Projects/range-debug/`** — documents the [debugging case](#debugging-case--graph-guided-bug-fix) (bug-focused `hot.md`, knowledge before/after). The community-size and experiment charts elsewhere in this README are exported by the notebook (`assets/`).

## Evidence discipline (Part-C)

Every claim carries an **evidence class**, end to end (extractor → findings → fix-eligibility):

| Class | Meaning | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| **EXTRACTED** | read directly from syntax (conf 1.0 / 0.9) | may state as fact; only EXTRACTED-only findings are fix-eligible |
| **INFERRED** | unique-symbol resolution of a bare name (conf 0.6) | must be hedged with its confidence |
| **AMBIGUOUS** | a documented dotted-path that resolves to nothing | a **stop-flag** for human triage — never an input to automated change |

This is why the single AMBIGUOUS edge (the removed `make_line_iter`) was triaged by a human, not silently consumed, and why the fix loop refuses to touch a finding whose chain isn't EXTRACTED end-to-end.

## Configuration guide

All tunables live in versioned JSON under `config/` (zero hardcoded values in code); **secrets come only from the environment.**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `setup.json` | models, retrieval caps, detector thresholds, budget, vault project/domains, fixloop test command |
| `rate_limits.json` | per-service rate windows for the gatekeeper |
| `logging_config.json` | structured-logging setup |

**Override convention:** any key can be overridden at runtime with `HW4__<dotted__path>` (e.g. `HW4__retrieval__ego_radius=1` — exactly how run 2 was tuned without editing committed config). **Secrets** (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) are read from the environment via `config.get_secret()` and never from JSON — a committed config can't leak a key.

Selected `setup.json` keys:

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `models.{cheap,strong}` | `gpt-4o-mini` | tier routing (narratives = cheap, edits/experiment = strong) |
| `retrieval.{ego_radius,max_nodes,max_seeds,k_pages}` | 2 / 40 / 3 / 3 | graph-context size (run 2 → 1 / 20 / 2 / 2) |
| `budget.{max_usd,warn_usd}` | 10 / 7 | firewall + warn threshold |
| `loop.{max_iterations,step_timeout_seconds}` | 3 / 300 | fix-loop bounds |
| `fixloop.test_command` | `uv run --no-project --isolated …` | target's suite (`--isolated` keeps werkzeug's `[tool.uv]` dev-groups out) |

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/hw4/sdk/` | `Hw4Sdk` facade + operation modules (CLI & agents hold zero logic) |
| `src/hw4/shared/` | config, **API Gatekeeper**, token ledger, process runner, gated LLM client |
| `src/hw4/services/` | extractor, metrics/diff, vault+wiki, retrieval, detectors, fix loop, experiment, CrewAI, dashboard |
| `tests/` | unit+integration, mirrors `src/` 1:1; `tests/fixtures/mini_repo/` is the planted-defect answer key |
| `config/` | versioned JSON — zero hardcoded values; secrets only via env |
| `docs/` | PRD/PLAN/TODO, **7 mechanism PRDs**, SKILL protocols, SCORING_RUBRIC, PROMPTS log, TARGET_REPO |
| `data/` | frozen question dataset (sha256-sealed in `PRD_token_experiment.md`) |
| `examples/` | vendored real buggy repo (`andela/buggy-python`) — the discovered-bug target we fixed; runs green |
| `results/` | graph iterations, findings, FINDINGS.md, loop log, experiment artifacts, ledger, REPORT, dashboard |
| `notebooks/` | `analysis.ipynb` — restart-and-run-all from committed artifacts |
| `vault/` | Obsidian vault (taxonomy + wiki incl. SKILL mirrors) |
| `workspace/` | target clone (gitignored; regenerate via `RepoService.clone(url, commit=<SHA>)`) |

## Extension points

The system is built so a new capability is a small isolated change, not a rewrite (guidelines §12.1) — each axis of growth has one obvious seam:

| To add… | Do this | Selected by |
|---|---|---|
| **A detector** | subclass `Detector` (`services/detectors/base.py`), implement `detect(graph, metrics, config)`; add it to `all_detectors()` in `registry.py`; add a `FindingKind` if it's a new kind | runs in every `analyze` |
| **A graph backend** | implement `extract(root, config, iteration) -> Graph`; register it in `_BACKENDS` in `graph_runner.py` | `config graph.backend` |
| **An LLM provider** | add a transport in `shared/transports.py` (the only code allowed to touch a provider SDK); usage tokens still come from the API | `config llm.provider` |
| **An agent role** | add an entry to `ROLE_DEFINITIONS` in `services/agents/roles.py` — the gated LLM bridge is wired in automatically | `make_agent("<role>", sdk.llm)` |
| **A CLI command / SDK op** | op module in `sdk/*_ops.py` → method on `Hw4Sdk` → subparser + dispatch in `main.py` (the `evaluate` / `debug` pattern) | `hw4 <command>` |
| **A node type / relation / evidence class** | extend the frozensets in `graph_models.py` / the enums in `constants.py`; normalization degrades anything unknown to `AMBIGUOUS` at one boundary | — |

Two invariants make these safe: whatever a backend emits is normalized at a **single boundary** (`Graph.from_dict`), and every tunable lives in `config/` (no code change to retune). So an extension is testable in isolation and can't silently break the frozen evidence.

## Key design decisions (ADRs in `docs/PLAN.md` §5)

- **One choke point** for every external call (`ApiGatekeeper`): rate limits, queue-not-drop, bounded retries, budget firewall, JSONL ledger. The LLM client *cannot be constructed* without it.
- **Evidence as a first-class enum** from extractor to fix-eligibility (above).
- **Deterministic spine, LLM at the edges** — metrics/diffs/detectors/loop are plain Python; the LLM writes narratives, plans, and edits only, through the gate.
- **Two graph backends** (ADR-4, revised): a real Graphify node-link adapter ships *and* the in-repo AST backend stays the default, so the frozen experiment/findings reproduce without an external tool while a real Graphify run drops in at one boundary.
- **Provider-swappable** (ADR-3): proven live by config-switching to OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` for both tiers.

## Reproducing the analysis

```bash
# 1. clone the target at the pinned SHA (gitignored workspace)
uv run hw4 graph https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug   # or RepoService.clone(url, commit=<SHA>)

# 2. deterministic graph (identical content hash on rebuild — see VALIDATION.md)
uv run hw4 graph workspace/target --iteration 0

# 3. detectors → 8 hypotheses; 2 validations + 6 reasoned rejections
uv run hw4 analyze

# 4. notebook: build + execute headlessly from committed artifacts
uv run --with nbformat python scripts/build_notebook.py
uv run --with nbformat --with nbclient --with ipykernel --with matplotlib python scripts/execute_notebook.py
```

## Quality standards — ISO/IEC 25010 conformance

Assessed against the eight ISO/IEC 25010 product-quality characteristics (guidelines §13):

| Characteristic | How this project addresses it |
|---|---|
| **Functional suitability** | Every FR has acceptance criteria (PRD §6); KPIs verified (TL;DR table); detectors scored against a planted answer key — confusion matrix **P=0.75 / R=1.00** ([`CONFUSION_MATRIX.md`](results/CONFUSION_MATRIX.md)). |
| **Performance efficiency** | The thesis itself — graph-guided retrieval uses **58.7% fewer tokens** at equal answer quality; full pipeline < 10 min (NFR-18); the I/O-bound wiki phase is parallelized (§15). |
| **Compatibility** | Provider-swappable LLM (`llm.provider`) and two graph backends (`graph.backend`); one normalized graph contract every consumer reads (`Graph.from_dict`). |
| **Usability** | User-manual-level README (install · usage tour · config guide · screenshots); a 1:1 thin CLI with `--help` on every subcommand. |
| **Reliability** | ~96% coverage incl. error paths; the Gatekeeper **queues-not-drops** + retries; the fix loop reverts on any regression; graphs are content-hash reproducible. |
| **Security** | Secrets only via env (`.env` gitignored, `.env-example` committed); a grep gate blocks hardcoded secrets/keys; the key is never printed or logged. |
| **Maintainability** | SDK + services modularity, ≤150 code-lines/file, ruff-0, OOP without duplication, **7 mechanism PRDs** + ADRs, and documented [extension points](#extension-points). |
| **Portability** | `uv`-managed env (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`), relative paths only, config-driven throughout; runs fully locally except the LLM API. |

## Quality, cost & limitations

- **Gates (law before every commit):** `scripts/check_gates.py` → ruff 0 · pytest+coverage ≈96% · every file ≤150 code lines · no hardcodes in `src/` · no secrets in tracked files · no broken vault wikilinks → **GATES: GREEN**.
- **Cost:** the entire werkzeug run cost **$0.088** of the $10 firewall across **109 gated calls** (vault wiki + fix-loop edit + 60 experiment cells over runs 1–2 + agent narratives), every one ledgered. The retired click run's ledger is preserved in git history.
- **Honest limitations:**
  - Quality was scored by a **blind LLM-as-judge** (transparently labeled, not a human panel); `results/experiment/SCORING.md` documents the method and supports an independent human re-score. For this target the ≥70% *savings aspiration* conflicts with quality (run-2 over-tuning) — the validated headline is the quality-preserving 58.7%.
  - The *architectural* fix loop produced a NO_SAFE_ACTION (a valid, evidenced negative), not a green merge — by design, it only accepts a graph-metric improvement. The *functional* debugging case **is** fixed end-to-end (red→green, `results/BUG_ANALYSIS.md`).
  - The default graph backend is the deterministic in-repo AST extractor, chosen so the frozen experiment/findings reproduce without an external tool; a **real Graphify node-link adapter ships** and is selectable via `graph.backend` (ADR-4, revised — the contract is normalized at one boundary).
  - Module-level constants/attributes aren't in the symbol index (a known INFERRED-layer precision cost, documented in `PRD_graph_pipeline.md`).
